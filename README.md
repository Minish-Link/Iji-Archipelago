# Iji Archipelago Randomizer v1.2.0

## By MinishLink, w/ assistance from Ladybunne

### Setup

To connect to a server, change the values in the ConnectionInfo.ini file to match your slot name, server address/port, and password (if there is one),
then launch the game and press Connect on the main menu.

### Where is the Music?

While I am able to modify and distribute the source code, I may not be allowed to distribute the music files, as they are outside the source project file, So to play it safe I did not include those files.
To get the music, you will need to either download the original game at https://remar.se/daniel/iji.php or download the High Quality soundtrack at https://remar.se/daniel/games/ijimusic.zip.
Then just dump the .wav music files from there into the randomizer's music folder.

### How do I get to this location?

Some of the locations in Iji can be very tricky to reach, especially if you are unfamiliar with the game and/or its secrets. If you are not sure how you are intended to do something, Remar Games has a handy guide at https://remar.se/daniel/iji2guide.php that will explain how to do pretty much anything in this game.

## What does this mod change?

This mod restricts what sectors you can access and how many points you are allowed to invest in the 7 stats until you obtain items that gradually remove these restrictions.
Instead of playing through the campaign in a continuous playthrough, Sectors are accessed via a menu akin to the Single Sector Warp from the vanilla game.
Visiting certain locations or doing certain things send checks. These include:

* Leveling up
* Reaching Checkpoints
* Completing Sectors
* Increasing Stat Levels
* Finding Ribbons
* Finding Posters
* Finding Supercharges
* Reading Logbooks
* Obtaining Weapons
* Combining Weapons
* Maxing out Stats
* Opening Secured Boxes
* Picking up Nano Overloads
* Jump and Armor Upgrades


In addition to the Sector and Stat items, this randomizer also optionally adds:

* Special Traits (the ones you normally get from maxing out a stat)
* Supercharges
* Ribbons (MacGuffins required to access your goal)
* Fire Anytime, originally a debug feature that lets you shoot while midair or ducking,
* Jump Upgrades
* Armor Upgrades
* Filler Items

  * Health Pickup
  * Armor Pickup
  * Ammo Pickups
  * Nano/XP Pickups
  * Nano Overload

* Trap Items

  * Rocket to the Face (Spawns a rocket that flies toward you.)
  * Blits (Spawns a handful of blit enemies that damage only Iji.)
  * Null Drive (Glitches some of the background images, one of the effects of the Null Driver.)
  * Turbo Mode (Makes the game speed faster for 20 seconds.)
  * Nap (Knocks Iji unconscious for 10 seconds, or until she takes damage.)
  * Clown Shoes (Makes your footsteps squeak for 60 seconds.)
  * Banana (Spawns a totally harmless banana :^] )

### Story

Although the mod uses Single Sector Warp to access levels, it will rememberthe decisions you make as you play, including total kill count, the truce in Sector 3, etc.

## Notes

This apworld has Universal Tracker Integration, including an internal poptracker map to show exact locations of each check, and the ability to track your world without the respective YAML
