# Iji Archipelago Randomizer v1.0.0
## By MinishLink, w/ assistance from Ladybunne

### Setup
To connect to a server, change the values in the ConnectionInfo.ini file to match your slot name, server address/port, and password (if there is one),
then launch the game and press Connect on the main menu.

### Where is the Music?
While I am able to modify and distribute the source code, I may not be allowed to distribute the music files, as they are outside the source project file, So to play it safe I did not include those files.
To get the music, you will need to either download the original game at https://remar.se/daniel/iji.php or download the High Quality soundtrack at https://remar.se/daniel/games/ijimusic.zip.
Then just dump the .wav music files from there into the randomizer's music folder.

### How do I get to this location?
Some of the locations in Iji can be very tricky to reach, especially if you are unfamiliar with the game and/or its secrets. If you are not sure how you are intended to do something, Remar Games has a handy guide at https://remar.se/daniel/iji2guide.php that will explain how to do pretty much anything in this game.

## What does this mod change?
This mod restricts what sectors you can access and how many points you are allowed to invest in the 7 stats until you obtain items that gradually remove these restrictions.
Instead of playing through the campaign in a continuous playthrough, Sectors are accessed via a menu akin to the Single Sector Warp from the vanilla game.
Visiting certain locations or doing certain things send checks. These include:
- Leveling up
- Completing Sectors
- Increasing Stat Levels
- Finding Ribbons
- Finding Posters
- Finding Supercharges
- Reading Logbooks
- Obtaining Weapons
- Combining Weapons
- Maxing out Stats
In addition to the Sector and Stat items, this randomizer also optionally adds:
- Special Traits (the ones you normally get from maxing out a stat)
    - SUPPRESSION
    - IMPROVED AUTOLOADING
    - ADVANCED RECOVERY
    - CYBERNETIC ENDURANCE
    - ELECTRONIC MASTERY
    - VENGEANCE
    - GLORY
- Supercharges
- Ribbons (for accessing Sector Z, see below)
- Filler Items
    - Health Pickup
    - Armor Pickup
    - Ammo Pickups
    - Nano/XP Pickups
    - Nano Overload
- Trap Items
    - Rocket to the Face (Spawns a rocket that flies toward you.)
    - Blits (Spawns a handful of blit enemies that damage only Iji.)
    - Null Drive (Glitches some of the background images, one of the effects of the Null Driver.)
    - Turbo Mode (Makes the game speed faster for 20 seconds.)
    - Nap (Knocks Iji unconscious for 10 seconds, or until she takes damage.)
    - Clown Shoes (Makes your footsteps squeak for 60 seconds.)

### Story
Although the mod uses Single Sector Warp to access levels, it will attempt to maintain the decisions you make as you play, including total kill count, the truce in Sector 3, etc.
Some small differences are made to pacifist route items and locations. Notably:
- The portal leading to Deep Sector in Sector 9 only requires that you kill 5 or fewer enemies in Sector 9 to access.
- The strength and crack door blocking a logbook do not disappear if the bunker survives, and you will be able to fire your weapons here to open it.
- The Massacre in Sector X only requires that you kill 0 enemies in Sector X, and does not factor in kills from previous sectors.

### Regarding Sector Z
Accessing Sector normally requires finding 10 Posters to access, however the Iji apworld lets you customize this requirement, requiring a combination of finding up to 10 Poster locations and obtaining up to 10 Ribbon items that are added to the item pool.
The portal inside Sector Z that leads to the Null Driver also has its own Poster and/or Ribbon requirement to access.
If Sector Z or Sector Y locations are not added to your world, and if Sector Z or Sector Y are not your goal, Sector Z will be inaccessible.

## Notes
While the game is able to display items that you receive, it won't display who sent them to you, nor will you be able to see what items you are sending or who you're sending them to. Until a recent items display is added, if you would like to see this information, you will need to connect a text client to the server.
If you would like to report a bug, or recommend a feature, forward it to @minishlink in the Iji thread in the Archipelago discord server!
